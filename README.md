# Ludum-Dare-48

Play as a little candle descending into the abyss and fighting monsters along the way.

This jam was tough and and tried my best I definitely learned a lot and grew my skills. There are some bugs and balancing issues I wasnâ€™t able to clean up but I think it turned out alright in the end :D.

-The core idea was thought up between me , my friends and the viewers of my stream.

The music was made by my friend Josh! <3
